# AU Base FHIR Implementation Guide

[AU Base](http://build.fhir.org/ig/hl7au/au-fhir-base/) is provided to support the use of HL7<sup>&reg;</sup> FHIR<sup>&reg;&copy;</sup> in an Australian context. AU Base implementation presents Australian use concepts defined via FHIR processable artefacts; these are collaborative outputs with agreed approaches to varied kinds of healthcare related information based on the core FHIR R4 specification as base profiles that can be further constrained in a separate implementation guide for a particular usage.

This guide alone does not constrain profiles sufficiently to ensure implementation use cases can be met.

For an implementation guide that has basic constraints to support many uses it is recommended that the [AU Core implementation guide](http://build.fhir.org/ig/hl7au/au-fhir-core/) is used. The implementable AU Core specification references and uses AU Base profiles, this constrains elements further and defines an expected level of interface interaction support around profiles. If an implementation is AU Core conformant this allows a level of core capability to be assumed.
