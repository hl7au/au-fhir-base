# AU Base FHIR Implementation Guide

[AU Base](http://build.fhir.org/ig/hl7au/au-fhir-base/) is provided to support the use of HL7<sup>&reg;</sup> FHIR<sup>&reg;&copy;</sup> in an Australian context. AU Base implementation presents Australian use concepts defined via FHIR processable artefacts; these are collaborative outputs with agreed approaches to varied kinds of healthcare related information based on the core FHIR R4 specification as base profiles that can be further constrained in a separate implementation guide for a particular usage.

This guide alone does not constrain profiles sufficiently to ensure implementation use cases can be met.

For an implementation guide that has basic constraints to support many uses it is recommended that the [AU Core implementation guide](http://build.fhir.org/ig/hl7au/au-fhir-core/) is used. The implementable AU Core specification references and uses AU Base profiles, this constrains elements further and defines an expected level of interface interaction support around profiles. If an implementation is AU Core conformant this allows a level of core capability to be assumed.

## Contributing to AU Base Development

### 1. Join the HL7 AU FHIR Working Group

Email fhirwglist@hl7.com.au to join the HL7 AU FHIR working group.

### 2. Discuss an issue in chat.fhir.org

If you have a question, feature request, or proposed change, the best place to start is Zulip e.g. the https://chat.fhir.org/#narrow/stream/179166-implementers stream. If what you want to discuss is specific to Australia you can post in the Australia stream https://chat.fhir.org/#narrow/stream/179173-australia.

### 3. Log a HL7 Jira issue

If you have a question, feature request, or proposed change, the best place to start is by logging a [FHIR IG Jira issue](https://jira.hl7australia.com/projects/FHIRIG/issues) on the HL7 AU Jira site directly or use the ![Propose-a-change](https://github.com/hl7au/au-fhir-core/assets/116611317/642b45cb-c82e-4fb5-a24c-37b263289fac) option at the bottom of each page of the IG to submit a JIRA issue.

### 4. Discuss with the team

Once the issue is logged, you should discuss with the team on [chat.fhir.org in the australia > AU Base topic](https://chat.fhir.org/#narrow/stream/179173-australia/topic/AU.20Base) before attempting to make changes yourself. It's important to coordinate with the other people working on the project.

### 5. Create a pull request

When everyone has agreed on a course of action, IG changes should be submitted as a pull request for review in this repository.
