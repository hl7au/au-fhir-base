            <p>This example demonstrates how a birth or deceased date with unknown day, estimated month and accurate year would be represented.</p>
            <p>Note that "2004-06-00" is NOT a valid FHIR date.</p>
            <p>Details include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>A valid FHIR date example for birth date and deceased date is "2004-06-08” but not "2004-06-00".</li>
                <li>A date accuracy indicator of "UEA" indicates that the day is unknown but month is an estimate and year is accurate.</li>
                <li>When a code value contains "U", the corresponding date components (individual or combination) for birth or deceased dates must be ignored.</li>
                <li>When a code value contains "A", the corresponding date components (individual or combination) for birth or deceased dates must be accurate.</li>
