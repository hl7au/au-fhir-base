**AU Base Medication** *[[FMM 2](guidance.html)]*

This profile defines a medication structure that localises core concepts, including terminology, for use in an Australian context.

The purpose of this profile is to provide national level agreement on core localised concepts. 

This profile does not force conformance to core localised concepts. It enables implementers and modellers to make their own rules, i.e. [profiling](http://hl7.org/fhir/profiling.html), about how to support these concepts for specific implementation needs.


#### Extensions
Extensions used in this profile:
* Medication.code.coding: [Medication Type](StructureDefinition-medication-type.html)

Potentially useful extensions:
* Medication: [Medication Brand Name](StructureDefinition-medication-brand-name.html)
* Medication: [Medication Generic Name](StructureDefinition-medication-generic-name.html)


#### Usage Notes

* [PBS Item Code](https://www.pbs.gov.au/pbs/home) - Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme coding, claiming context is not relevant as medicine coding
* [Medication Package Global Trade Item Number](http://terminology.hl7.org/ValueSet/v3-GTIN) - Global Trade Item Number (GTIN) physical product reference
* [AMT Medicines](https://healthterminologies.gov.au/fhir/ValueSet/australian-medication-1) - Australian Medicines Terminology, national drug terminology
* [MIMS Package](https://www.mims.com.au/index.php) - commonly used medicine coding
