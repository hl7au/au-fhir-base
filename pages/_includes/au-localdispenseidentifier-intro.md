**AU Local Dispense Identifier**  *[[FMM Level 0](guidance.html)]*

This identifier profile defines a local dispense identifier in an Australian context. A local dispense identifier is an organisation's identifier for a prescription in that organisation's local system set of dispense records.

A dispense record identifier is typically assigned by the dispensing system and allows linking of a dispensing record to the dispensing system's local identifier.


#### Extensions

No extensions are used in this profile.


#### Usage Notes
It is preferable that an organisation uses their own local system identifier namespace but if that is not available then an organisation can use their HPI-O to construct a legal globally unique identifier system for their local identifiers. 

See the Australian Digital Health Agency's [R4 FAQ](https://github.com/AuDigitalHealth/ci-fhir-r4/wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions) for guidance on constructing an HPI-O scoped[<sup>[1]</sup>](http://ns.electronichealth.net.au/id/hpio-scoped/dispense/1.0/index.html){:target="_blank"} local dispense identifier.
