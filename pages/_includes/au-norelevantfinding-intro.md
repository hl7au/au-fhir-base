**AU Assertion of No Relevant Finding** *[[FMM 1](guidance.html)]*

This profile provides an observation information structure for asserting a clinical judgement that there are no items of specific interest, e.g. allergies, no medications, for a patient.

An assertion of no relevant finding may be used in continuity of care or transfer or care related lists and composition sections.

#### Usage Notes
This observation may be time bound, e.g. the patient is not currently taking medications on this date. In such a scenario status should be 'final'.

In a summary document, this observation may be used to positively state that there is no known history of conditions for  a patient. In such a scenario status should be 'final'.
