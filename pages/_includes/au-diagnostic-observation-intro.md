**AU Base Diagnostic Observation**  *[[FMM Level 0](guidance.html)]*

This profile defines an observation structure that includes core localisation concepts for use as a diagnostic result observation in an Australian context.

Forthcoming work around this profile is expected to result in a value set representing the Standard for Pathology Informatics in Australia - Reporting codes bound as a slice on the code element.

The bodySite extension may be used when a coded concept does not provide the necessary detail needed for the use case.
