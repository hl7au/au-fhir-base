**Extension: Medication Brand Name** *[[FMM Level 1](guidance.html)]*

This extension applies to the Medication, MedicationRequest, MedicationDispense amd MedicationStatement resources and provides text brand name of a medication.

It is recommended to include multiple codings where brand and generic medication concepts are to be represented where available rather than text name only.

This brand name can be included as an additional name representation of the brand medication and may used in the case where no brand coded concept is available.
