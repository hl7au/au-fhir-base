**Extension: Medication Generic Name**  *[[FMM Level 1](guidance.html)]*

This extension applies to the Medication, MedicationRequest, MedicationDispense and MedicationStatement resources and provides generic name of a medication.

This provides the generic medication text name for an associated medication, this may not be the same as the subject medication (prescribed, dispensed or stated)
but may be used to provide an additional or equivalent drug name that is a generic medication concept.

It is recommended to include multiple codings where brand and generic medication concepts are to be represented where available rather than text name only.

This generic name can be included as an additional name representation of the generic medication and may be used in the case where no generic coded concept is available.
