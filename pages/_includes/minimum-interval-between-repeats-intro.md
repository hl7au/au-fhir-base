**Extension: Minimum Interval Between Repeats**  *[[FMM Level 1](guidance.html)]*

This extension applies to MedicationRequest resource and represents the minimum allowed time period between dispensing repeats.

Where the prescription is for a Schedule 8 medicine and the dispensing of the prescription is authorised to be repeated, the minimum intervals at which it may be dispensed must be written on the prescription by the prescriber.

This is different to the PBS rules for claiming subsidies for repeat prescriptions. This may be used for situations where a prescriber wants to limit access â€“ e.g. if there are safety concerns or if the subject of care is taking greater than the prescribed dose.
