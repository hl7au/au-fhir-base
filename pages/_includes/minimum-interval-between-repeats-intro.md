**Extension: Minimum Interval Between Repeats**  *[[FMM Level 1](guidance.html)]*

This extension applies to the MedicationRequest resource and is used to represent the minimum allowed time period between dispensing repeats.

This is different to the PBS rules for claiming subsidies for repeat prescriptions. This may be used for situations where a prescriber wants to limit access, e.g. if there are safety concerns or if the subject of care is taking greater than the prescribed dose.
