**AU Care Agency Employee Identifier**  *[[FMM Level 0](guidance.html)]*

This identifier profile defines a My Health Record assigned Care Agency Employee (CAE) identifier[<sup>[1]</sup>](http://ns.electronichealth.net.au/id/pcehr/caei/1.0/index.html){:target="_blank"} in an Australian context. A CAE identifier may be issued to an employee of, or person under contracted arrangement with, a Care Agency who wishes to participate in the My Health Record.

The purpose of this profile is to provide national level agreement on core localised concepts. 

This profile does not force conformance to core localised concepts. It enables implementers and modellers to make their own rules, i.e. [profiling](http://hl7.org/fhir/profiling.html), about how to support these concepts for specific implementation needs.
