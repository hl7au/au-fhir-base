**Receiving Application Extension** *[[FMM Level 1](guidance.html)]*

This extension defines a HL7v2 receiving application value for HL7v2 routing purposes associated with an endpoint.
This content allows a sender using these endpoint details to include Receiving Application (MSH-5) information in HL7v2 messages sent via this channel which allow correct delivery within the receiving system.
