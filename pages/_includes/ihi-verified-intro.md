**Extension: IHI Verified** *[[FMM Level 1](guidance.html)]*

This extension applies to the [Identifier datatype](http://hl7.org/fhir/datatypes.html#identifier) and is used to represent the date/time that the Individual Healthcare Identifier (IHI) was verified with HI Services.

This is not the date that it was created by the HI Services, but when it was checked. This is often required to know how recently the identifier was checked, and if it must be re-verified before using it.
