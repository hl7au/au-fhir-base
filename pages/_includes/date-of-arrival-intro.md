**Extension: Date of Arrival in Australia**  *[[FMM Level 0](guidance.html)]*

This extension applies to the Patient, RelatedPerson, and Practitioner resources and defines the date of arrival in an Australian context. 

The date of arrival is when a person (born outside of Australia) first arrived in Australia, from another country, with the intention of living in Australia for one year or more. This date is captured once for a person and is not subsequently updated with subsequent arrival years.

This element is a part of Cultural and Linguistic Diversity (CALD) data set. It is an important indicator of cultural identity, and provides further information about a person's cultural values and practices which can be significant in determining service type, support required, and possible needs.
