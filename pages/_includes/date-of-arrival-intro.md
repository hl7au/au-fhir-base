The date of arrival is when a person (born outside of Australia) first arrived in Australia, from another country, with the intention of living in Australia for one year or more. This date is captured once for a person and is not subsequently updated with subsequent arrivals.

This element is a part of Cultural and Linguistic Diversity (CALD) data set. It is an important indicator of cultural identity, and provides further information about a person's cultural values and practices which can be significant in determining service type, support required, and possible needs.
