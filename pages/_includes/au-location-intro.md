**AU Base Location** *[[FMM Level 3](guidance.html)]*

This profile defines a location structure that localises core concepts, including identifiers and terminology, for use in an Australian context.

The purpose of this profile is to provide national level agreement on core localised concepts. 

This profile does not force conformance to core localised concepts. It enables implementers and modellers to make their own rules, i.e. [profiling](http://hl7.org/fhir/profiling.html), about how to support these concepts for specific implementation needs.


#### Identifiers
These definitions, defined as profiles of [Identifier](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/datatypes.html#Identifier), represent common data held in the Location.identifier element:
* [Location Specific Practice Number](StructureDefinition-au-locationspecificpracticenumber.html) [<sup>[1]</sup>](http://ns.electronichealth.net.au/id/location-specific-practice-number/index.html){:target="_blank"}
* [National Association of Testing Authorities (NATA) Site Number](StructureDefinition-au-natasitenumber.html) [<sup>[1]</sup>](http://hl7.org.au/id/nata-site/index.html){:target="_blank"}

#### Extensions
