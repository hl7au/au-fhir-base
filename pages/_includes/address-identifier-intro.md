**Extension: Address Identifier** *[[FMM Level 0](guidance.html)]*

This extension applies to the [Address](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/datatypes.html#Address) data type and is used to represent an identifier for an address. 

An address identifier does not form part of the address itself, e.g. a street number. It is a unique identifier associated with a location address and may be used to look up an address, validate an address, or link to other data relating to an address.

#### Examples

[Postal address (with DPID and G-NAF Identifier) and work address in Darwin, NT](Patient-address-example3.html)
