**AU Biological Sex Assigned at Birth** *[[FMM Level 0](guidance.html)]*

This profile is provided as a common representation of the sex assigned to a person at birth, usually based on physical properties that are visually apparent at birth.

This profile is typically used to capture sex assigned to a person during a birth encounter. However, it can also be used outside the birth encounter to record sex previously assigned at the time of birth.

This profile is not intended for capturing sex recorded on a personâ€™s birth certificate, noting that the values for sex assigned at birth and sex recorded on a birth certiticate for a person will typically align.

This profile is not appropriate for recording a patient's gender. Patient's gender is recorded as part of the demographic data about the patient, see [AU Base Patient](StructureDefinition-au-patient.html). 

Forthcoming work on supporting other biological sex concepts is expected to result in more profiles published in this implementation guide.
