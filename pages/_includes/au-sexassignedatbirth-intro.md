**AU Biological Sex Assigned at Birth** *[[FMM Level 0](guidance.html)]*

This profile is provided as a common representation of the sex assigned to a person at birth, usually based on physical properties that are visually apparent at birth.

This profile is tipically used to capture sex assigned to a person during a birth encounter but is not limited to be recorded during that encounter.

This profile is not intended for capturing sex recorder on a person's birth certificate, noting that the sex assigned at birth and sex recorder on a birth certiticate values for a person's will tipically
align.

This profile is not appropriate for recording a patient's gender. Patient's gender is recorded as part of the demographic data about the patient, see [AU Base Patient](StructureDefinition-au-patient.html). 

Forthcoming work on supporting other biological sex concepts is expected to result in more profiles published in this implementation guide.
