**AU Biological Sex Assigned at Birth** *[[FMM Level 0](guidance.html)]*

This profile provides an observation information structure for a patient’s biological sex[<sup>[1]</sup>](https://meteor.aihw.gov.au/content/index.phtml/itemId/635233){:target="_blank"}[<sup>[2]</sup>](https://www.abs.gov.au/statistics/standards/standard-sex-gender-variations-sex-characteristics-and-sexual-orientation-variables/latest-release){:target="_blank"} assigned at birth. Biological sex assigned at birth refers to what was determined by sex characteristics observed at birth or infancy, including genital and chromosome composition. Sex assigned at birth is captured once for a patient and is not expected to change within their lifetime. 

**Boundaries and Relationships**

Biological sex assigned at birth should not be used for:
* the concept of a person's gender such as gender identity (part of a person’s personal and social identity) or administrative gender (record keeping purposes)
* birth certificate sex, noting that the values would be expected to align early in a person’s lifetime but that the biological sex recorded on a person’s birth certificate may change over a person’s lifetime and should be denoted by an Observation.code that clearly states that birth certificate sex is what has been captured e.g. LOINC 76689-9 - Sex assigned at birth 
* observations of biological sex that occurred later in life including later clinical finding that are the result of a specific measurement e.g. gonadal, ductal or phenotypic

For more information, see [AU Base Patient](http://build.fhir.org/ig/hl7au/au-fhir-base/StructureDefinition-au-patient.html) and the [Patient Gender and Sex](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/patient.html#gender) section in [Patient](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/patient.html) resource. Work on supporting other biological sex concepts is expected to result in more profiles published in this implementation guide.
