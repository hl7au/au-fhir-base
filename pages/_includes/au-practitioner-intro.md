**AU Base Practitioner** *[[FMM Level 3](guidance.html)]*

This profile defines a practitioner structure that localises core concepts, including identifiers and terminology, for use in an Australian context.

The purpose of this profile is to provide national level agreement on core localised concepts. 

This profile does not force conformance to core localised concepts. It enables implementers and modellers to make their own rules, i.e. [profiling](http://hl7.org/fhir/profiling.html), about how to support these concepts for specific implementation needs.
#### Identifiers
These definitions, defined as profiles of [Identifier](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/datatypes.html#Identifier), represent common data held in the Practitioner.identifier element:
* [Healthcare Provider Identifier - Individual (HPI-I)](StructureDefinition-au-hpiinumber.html) [<sup>[1]</sup>](http://ns.electronichealth.net.au/id/hi/hpii/1.0/index.html){:target="_blank"}

#### Extensions
No extensions are used in this profile.

#### Usage Notes
Where a sending system includes a practitioner's qualification using their AHPRA Registration Number, this should be done using Practitioner.qualification(ahpraRegistration). 
A practitioner's AHPRA Registration Number may also be included as an identifier, using Practitioner.identifier(ahpraRegistration).
