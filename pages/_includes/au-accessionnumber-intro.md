**AU Accession Number**  *[[FMM Level 0](guidance.html)]*

This identifier profile defines an accession number in an Australian context. Accession numbers are typically assigned by a diagnostic imaging system or clinical laboratory system and depending on the domain an accession number may for example identify a specimen, imaging examination, or biological polymer sequence.   

#### Usage Notes
It is preferable that an organisation uses their own local system identifier namespace but if that is not available then an organisation can use their HPI-O to construct a legal globally unique identifier system for their local identifiers. 

See the Australian Digital Health Agency's [R4 FAQ](https://github.com/AuDigitalHealth/ci-fhir-r4/wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions) for guidance on constructing an HPI-O scoped[<sup>[1]</sup>](http://ns.electronichealth.net.au/id/hpio-scoped/accessionnumber/1.0/index.html){:target="_blank"} accession number.
