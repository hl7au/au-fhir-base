**AU Diagnostic Service Request** *[[FMM Level 0](guidance.html)]*

This profile defines a service request structure that includes core localisation concepts for use as a diagnostic service request in an Australian context.

Note: The procedure-targetBodyStructure extension should only used if not implicit in the code found in ServiceRequest.code. If the use case requires BodySite to be handled as a separate resource instead of an inline coded element (e.g. to identify and track separately) then use the standard extension [procedure-targetBodyStructure](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/extension-procedure-targetbodystructure.html). 

There are three preferred value sets when coding ServiceRequest.code:

*	an imaging order code is preferred to be a member of [https://healthterminologies.gov.au/fhir/ValueSet/imaging-procedure-1](https://healthterminologies.gov.au/fhir/ValueSet/imaging-procedure-1)
*	a pathology order code is preferred to be a member of set of codes published as the [Standard for Pathology Informatics in Australia - Requesting codes](https://www.rcpa.edu.au/getattachment/2489328b-10f1-41d8-a6e1-1476b77fb386/SPIA-Requesting-Pathology-Terminology-and-Codes.aspx) (a value set representation is forthcoming)
*	a specialist or other diagnostic order code is preferred to be a member of SNOMED CT-AU (a reference set and value set representation will be published this year)
