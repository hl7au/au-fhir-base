**AU Base Allergy Intolerance** *[[FMM Level 1](guidance.html)]*

This profile defines an allergy intolerance structure including core localisation concepts for use in an Australian context.

Note: The value set [Indicator of Hypersensitivity or Intolerance to Substance](https://healthterminologies.gov.au/fhir/ValueSet/indicator-hypersensitivity-intolerance-to-substance-1) is part of a staged approach to offering meaningful localised coding. There is significant redesign occurring in SNOMED CT content relating to allergies, adverse reactions and intolerances. Once the redesign is realised, projected to be 2019, a more focused value set reducing the clinical finding noise will be proposed.


#### Conversion
