This profile defines a condition structure that localises core concepts, including terminology, for use in an Australian context. The purpose of this profile is to provide national level agreement on core localised concepts. This profile does not force conformance to core localised concepts. It enables implementers and modellers to make their own rules, i.e. [profiling](http://hl7.org/fhir/profiling.html), about how to support these concepts for specific implementation needs. 

### Usage Notes

**Profile specific implementation guidance:**

* See the [Representing Body Site, Which May Include Laterality](generalguidance.md#representing-body-site-which-may-include-laterality) section for guidance on representing a relevant body site and associated laterality.

**Usages:**

* Examples for this Profile: [Condition/example0](Condition-example0.md)

You can also check for [usages in the FHIR IG Statistics](https://packages2.fhir.org/xig/resource/hl7.fhir.au.base|current/StructureDefinition/StructureDefinition-au-condition.json)
