  <description value="This profile provides an observation information structure for a patient’s biological sex assigned at birth. Biological sex assigned at birth refers to what was determined by sex characteristics observed at birth or infancy, including genital and chromosome composition. Sex assigned at birth is captured once for a patient and is not expected to change within their lifetime." />

      <comment value="A person's sex can change over the course of their lifetime. The biological sex assigned at birth may not match a person’s gender or the sex recorded on their birth certificate. Biological sex assigned at birth should not be used for observations that occurred later in life including later clinical findings that are the result of a specific measurement e.g. gonadal, ductal or phenotypic.
