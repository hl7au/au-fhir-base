  <description value="A person’s biological sex is based upon their sex characteristics, such as their chromosomes, hormones and reproductive organs. A person’s sex can change over the course of their lifetime and may differ from their sex assigned at birth. Sex assigned at birth refers to what was determined by sex characteristics observed at birth or infancy, including genital and chromosome composition. Sex assigned at birth is captured once for a person and is not expected to change within their lifetime" />
