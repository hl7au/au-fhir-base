			<h2>Australian Indigenous Status</h2>
			<p>Whether a person identifies as being of Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander origin, as represented by a code.<br/>
			The purpose of this data element is to provide information about whether persons identify as being of Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander origin.<br/>
			The following definition, commonly known as 'The Commonwealth Definition', was given in a High Court judgement in the case of Commonwealth v Tasmania (1983) 46 ALR 625.<br/>
			'An Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander is a person of Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander descent who identifies as an Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander and is accepted as such by the community in which he or she lives'.<br/>
			There are three components to the Commonwealth definition:<ul>
					<li>descent;</li>
					<li>self-identification; and</li>
					<li>community acceptance.</li>
				</ul>
				<br/>
In practice, it is not feasible to collect information on the community acceptance part of this definition in general purpose statistical and administrative collections and therefore standard questions on Indigenous status relate to descent and self-identification only.</p>
