# === INFORMATION 04: These issues are known FHIR standard and Extension Pack future version and current deprecations. ===
The discriminator type 'pattern' is deprecated in R5+. For future compatibility, you could consider using type=value with a pattern[x] instead (if this is not an inherited slicing) 
The extension http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/elementdefinition-maxValueSet|5.2.0 is deprecated
The extension http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/regex|5.2.0 is deprecated with the note: 'This was deprecated in favor of using a constraint on the element using FHIRPath, since constraints allow for the provision of a human readable message associated with the regex'

# === INFORMATION 05: This issue is inherited from FHIR R4 resource content included in profiles. ===
The string value contains text that looks like embedded HTML tags. If this content is rendered to HTML without appropriate post-processing, it may be a security risk

# === INFORMATION 06: Generated when expanding large ValueSets e.g. those containing SNOMED-CT ===
The value set expansion is too large, and only a subset has been displayed
