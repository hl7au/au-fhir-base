# === ERROR 01: Validation reports unknown PBS codes because PBS terminology is not published in FHIR format. These codes are expected and do not indicate an error. This error is accepted in AU Base 5.0.0. ===
Unknown code '11815W' in the CodeSystem 'http://pbs.gov.au/code/item'

# === WARNING 01: These are warnings for publication artefacts not used in HL7 AU specifications at this time and are accepted by the AU FHIR WG. These warnings were accepted in AU Base 5.0.0. ===
The HTML fragment 'ip-statements.xhtml' is not included anywhere in the produced implementation guide
An HTML fragment from the set [cross-version-analysis.xhtml, cross-version-analysis-inline.xhtml] is not included anywhere in the produced implementation guide
The HTML fragment 'globals-table.xhtml' is not included anywhere in the produced implementation guide

# === WARNING 02: Artefacts inherit multiple profiles for certain data types (e.g., Address, Identifier). The IG Publisher cannot match example instances to a single profile and generates these warnings. This behaviour is expected and consistent with the design of AU Base. These warnings were accepted in AU Base 5.0.0. ===
