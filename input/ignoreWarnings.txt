# === These warnings are suppressed as the IG Publisher cannot validate code systems and value sets from healthterminologies.gov.au because it cannot access those profiles. To rectify this issue, a package dependency will be created by NCTS and published in the FHIR registry. There is no timeline for completion of this enhancement. For more details see JIRA-48933 (https://jira.hl7.org/browse/FHIR-48933). ===
