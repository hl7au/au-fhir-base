#### AU Base 4.2.1-preview for testing 

This June 2024 preview snapshot of AU Base supports testing of AU Core prior to Ballot of AU Core R1.

Testing plays a crucial role in the development of AU Core. It helps to build an AU Core that is aligned with its intended purpose and is practical, and responsive to the diverse needs of various stakeholders.  

Testing AU Core helps identify issues, challenges, or gaps in the specification, enabling its improvement. During testing, implementers test their FHIR resources, software products, and/or proof of concepts with AU Core and provide essential feedback.

This testing period ends 08 September 2024.

To learn more about testing AU Core or express your interest in participating, see [AU Core FHIR IG Testing](https://confluence.hl7.org/display/HAFWG/AU+Core+FHIR+IG+Testing).
