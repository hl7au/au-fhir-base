### Usage Notes

**Profile specific implementation guidance:**
- Multiple Individual Healthcare Identifiers (IHIs) can be used in where the IHI status and/or IHI record status varies (e.g. deceased, provisional) though implementers should be aware when exchanging patient information that systems may not support multiple IHIs for an individual.
