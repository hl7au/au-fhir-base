This profile is intended to offer a common structure and expectations to record, exchange, and fetch a list of medications associated with a patient in an Australian healthcare context.

Forthcoming work around this profile is expected to result in guidance and additional structures that define types of medication lists, e.g. current medications or medication changes or prescription history. 

#### Usage Notes
An [assertion of no relevant finding](StructureDefinition-au-norelevantfinding.html) can be used to positively state that there is no history of immunisations for a patient or that the patient is known not to have current medications.

When capturing a related person as the author of the list, the extension Author as a Related Person should be used and List.source should not be included.
