  - *Woman or female* may be represented by sending the SNOMED CT code 446141000124107\|Identifies as female gender\|
  - *Non-binary* may be represented by sending the SNOMED CT code 33791000087105\|Identifies as nonbinary gender\|, see example [Patient/example4](Patient-example4.html)

  - *Prefer not to answer* may be represented by sending the code "asked-declined", see example [Patient/example0](Patient-example0.html)
  - *Not stated or inadequately described* may be represented by the code "unknown"
- Need for an interpreter service can be represented with the [interpreterRequired extension](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/extension-patient-interpreterrequired.html) set to "true" 
  - If the language for interpreter service is known, the language is included in `Patient.communication.language` and `Patient.communication.preferred` is set to "true". 
  - If communication.preferred has not been included, or is set to "false", systems should understand this as the language for the interpreter service is not known.
- See each Identifier profile page for guidance related to that identifier type.
