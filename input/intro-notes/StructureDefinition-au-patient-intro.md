The purpose of this profile is to provide national level agreement on core localised concepts.

This profile does not force conformance to core localised concepts. It enables implementers and modellers to make their own rules, i.e. profiling, about how to support these concepts for specific implementation needs.
### Guidance:

- This profile supports patient gender identity aligned to [Australian Bureau of Statics Standard for Sex, Gender, Variations of Sex Characteristics and Sexual Orientation Variables, 2020](https://www.abs.gov.au/statistics/standards/standard-sex-gender-variations-sex-characteristics-and-sexual-orientation-variables/latest-release#gender) using the [genderIdentity extension](http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/patient-genderIdentity) and [Gender Identity Response](https://healthterminologies.gov.au/fhir/ValueSet/gender-identity-response-1) value set.
  - *Man or male* may be represented by sending the code "446151000124109" (Identifies as male gender)
  - *Woman or female* may be represented by sending the code "446141000124107" (Identifies as female gender)
  - *Non-binary* may be represented by sending the code "33791000087105" (Identifies as nonbinary gender), see example [Patient/example4](Patient-example4.html)
  - *[I/They] use a different term (please specify)*  may be represented by sending only text and no code, see example [Patient/example7](Patient-example7.html)
  - *Prefer not to answer* may be represented by sending the code `asked-declined`, see example [Patient/example0](Patient-example0.html)
  - *Not stated or inadequately described* may be represented by the code `unknown`
Extensions under consideration:
* Patient: [Ethnicity](StructureDefinition-ethnicity.html)

### Usage Notes
Multiple Individual Healthcare Identifiers are supported particularly to support the recording of IHI values where the status and/or record status varies (e.g. deceased, provisional).

Medicare Number is defined as a 10 or 11 digit number. Whilst 10 digits is not sufficient to uniquely identify an individual it is a supported entry where systems do not support 11 digit content. If required profiles can constrain this slice further to restrict usage to 11 digits only as desired.
Medicare Numbers are not used for uniquely identifying patients, they are identifying information that can be used in conjunction with other elements such as name and date of birth appropriately to confirm identity.

To indicate an interpreter service is required, extension interpreter required=true should be set. If the language for interpreter service is known then it should be included in communication.language with communication.preferred=true. If communication.preferred=true is not set when interpreter required=true then it may be understood that an interpreter is required but the language for the interpreter service is not known.

Gender is supported as administrative gender for identifying patient records and other administrative requirements. The core extension [Gender Identity](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/extension-patient-genderidentity.html) is not yet supported in AU Base Patient as the terminology is considered inappropriate for use in Australia.
