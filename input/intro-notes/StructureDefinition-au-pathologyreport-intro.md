### Usage Notes
When constructing the report:
<ul>
<li>a local identifier is sent with a <a href="http://ns.electronichealth.net.au/id/hpio-scoped/report/1.0/index.html">HPI-O scoped</a> identifier namespace if there isn't a local namespace available (see the <a href="https://github.com/AuDigitalHealth/ci-fhir-r4/wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions">FAQ</a>) for more information</li>
<li>code matches one Observation.code referenced in result</li>
<li>effective[x] is the earliest specimen collection date time</li>
<li>performer is sent as one Organization (pathology laboratory) and one or more PractitionerRoles (pathologist)</li></ul>

For a report of a multi-test study or panel:
<ul>
<li>result is sent with the Observation representing the study / panel</li>  
<li>code is sent with the same code in that study / panel Observation</li>  
<li>the individual component tests are referenced by that Observation (Observation.hasMember) and not the DiagnosticReport</li>  
</ul>

If the pathology laboratory is a discipline specific laboratory then one of the appropriate discipline specific value sets may be more suitable for use than the entire reporting set available in the profile:
* [ValueSet : RCPA - SPIA Chemical Pathology Terminology Reference Set](https://www.healthterminologies.gov.au/integration/R4/fhir/ValueSet/spia-chemical-pathology-refset-3?ui:source=search)
* [ValueSet : RCPA - SPIA Haematology Terminology Reference Set](https://www.healthterminologies.gov.au/integration/R4/fhir/ValueSet/spia-haematology-refset-3?ui:source=search)
* [ValueSet : RCPA - SPIA Immunopathology Terminology Reference Set](https://www.healthterminologies.gov.au/integration/R4/fhir/ValueSet/spia-immunopathology-refset-3?ui:source=search)
* [ValueSet : RCPA - SPIA Microbiology Serology Molecular Pathology Terminology Reference Set](https://www.healthterminologies.gov.au/integration/R4/fhir/ValueSet/spia-microbiology-serology-molecular-refset-3?ui:source=search)
