An employee number is an organisation’s identifier for an individual employed by that organisation.

#### Usage Notes

It is preferable that an organisation uses their own local system identifier namespace but if that is not available then an organisation can use their ABN or HPI-O to construct a legal globally unique identifier system for their local identifiers. 

See the Australian Digital Health Agency's [R4 FAQ](https://github.com/AuDigitalHealth/ci-fhir-r4/wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions) for guidance on constructing an ABN-scoped[<sup>[1]</sup>](http://ns.electronichealth.net.au/id/abn-scoped/service-provider-individual/1.0/index.html){:target="_blank"} employee number or an HPI-O scoped[<sup>[2]</sup>](http://ns.electronichealth.net.au/id/hpio-scoped/service-provider-individual/1.0/index.html){:target="_blank"} employee number.
