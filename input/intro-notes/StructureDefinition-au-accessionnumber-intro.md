### Usage Notes

**Profile specific implementation guidance:**
- An organisation should use their own local system identifier namespace but if that is not available then see the guidance on [Business Identifiers](guidance.html#business-identifiers) on using an HPI-O to construct a legal globally unique identifier system for local identifiers.
