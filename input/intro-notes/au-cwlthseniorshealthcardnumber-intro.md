This definition supports sending the Centrelink Customer Reference Number (CRN)[<sup>[1]</sup>](https://www.servicesaustralia.gov.au/individuals/subjects/centrelink-customer-reference-number-crn){:target="_blank"}[<sup>[2]</sup>](http://meteor.aihw.gov.au/content/index.phtml/itemId/690579){:target="_blank"} (also referred to as unique identifier number (UIN) in the Centrelink Confirmation eServices (CCeS)) as displayed on the individual's Commonwealth Seniors Health Card. An individual's CRN is present as the primary identifier on different concession cards and is used to confirm concessions by most government agencies and utility providers.

A Commonwealth Seniors Health Card may be issued by Services Australia or Department of Veterans' Affairs (DVA) to retirees of age pension qualification age to assist with certain living costs by allowing access to specific goods and services at a concessional rate.

#### Usage Notes

Although a DVA-issued card will also include an individual's state-based DVA file number only the CRN should be sent as the Commonwealth Seniors Health Card number.
