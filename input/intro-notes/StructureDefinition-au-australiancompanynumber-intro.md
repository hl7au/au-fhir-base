#### Usage Notes

When coding type, the current recommended coding from the required [hl7VS-identifierType - AU Extended](ValueSet-au-v2-0203-extended.html) value set is 'XX' (Organization identifier) sent with a text value 'ACN'. However, it is expected that future versions of the Identifier Type valueset may contain a specific coding as 'ACN'.
