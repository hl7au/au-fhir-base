### Usage Notes
Where including information from Ahpra about a practitioner, Practitioner.qualification should be instantiated with either the extension [ahpraprofession-details](StructureDefinition-ahpraprofession-details.html) or [ahpraregistration-details](StructureDefinition-ahpraregistration-details.html). Detailed guidance on representing Ahpra data in Practitioner is available [here](http://hl7.org.au/notes/ahpra-registration-number/index.html){:target="_blank"}.

The [ahpraprofession-details](StructureDefinition-ahpraprofession-details.html) extension supports inclusion of an Ahpra profession code and information about conditions, undertakings, reprimands and cautions in a qualification element instance representing a practitioner’s Ahpra profession.

The [ahpraregistration-details](StructureDefinition-ahpraregistration-details.html) extension supports inclusion of an Ahpra profession code and information about division, speciality, registration status, endorsements and notations in a qualification element instance representing a practitioner’s Ahpra registration.

Tertiary qualifications and professional memberships should be represented by instantiating an instance of Practitioner.qualification for each qualification to be included. Where a suitable code is not yet available, textual representation may be provided in Practitioner.qualification.code.text. Work around terminology for Australian college memberships is being considered; if completed the concepts are expected to be available in the preferred value set [hl7VS-degreeLicenseCertificate - AU Extended](ValueSet-au-v2-0360-extended.html).
