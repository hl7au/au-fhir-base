**Upcoming NCTS ValueSet Availability**
Balloters should note that a request to NCTS to add a specific ValueSet with agreed changed terminology defined for binding to <code class="highlighter-rouge language-plaintext">AllergyIntolerance.reaction.manifestation</code> is pending release.
Consequently it is not available in this guide at the time of publishing.

Balloters should consider the content of the <a href="https://www.healthterminologies.gov.au/integration/R4/fhir/ValueSet/sctau-reference-set-142341000036103">indicative reference set</a> available now that the new NCTS ValueSet will be based on.

Related JIRA issue with details is <a href="https://jira.hl7.org/browse/FHIR-47076">FHIR-47076</a>.
