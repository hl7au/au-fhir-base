**Profile specific implementation guidance:**
- See each Identifier profile page for guidance related to that identifier type.
- This profile supports the related person's gender identity aligned to [Australian Bureau of Statics Standard for Sex, Gender, Variations of Sex Characteristics and Sexual Orientation Variables, 2020](https://www.abs.gov.au/statistics/standards/standard-sex-gender-variations-sex-characteristics-and-sexual-orientation-variables/latest-release#gender) using the [Individual Gender Identity extension](http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/individual-genderIdentity) and [Gender Identity Response](https://healthterminologies.gov.au/fhir/ValueSet/gender-identity-response-1) value set.
  - *Man or male* may be represented by sending the SNOMED CT code 446151000124109\|Identifies as male gender\|
  - *Woman or female* may be represented by sending the SNOMED CT code 446141000124107\|Identifies as female gender\|
  - *Non-binary* may be represented by sending the SNOMED CT code 33791000087105\|Identifies as nonbinary gender\|
  - *[I/They] use a different term (please specify)*  may be represented by sending only text and no code
  - *Prefer not to answer* may be represented by sending the code "asked-declined"
  - *Not stated or inadequately described* may be represented by the code "unknown"

- This profile supports a recorded sex or gender (RSG) value using the using the [Person Recorded Sex Or Gender](http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/individual-recordedSexOrGender) extension. RSG information includes the various sex and gender concepts that are often used in existing systems but are known NOT to represent a gender identity, sex parameter for clinical use, or attributes related to sexuality, such as sexual orientation, sexual activity, or sexual attraction.
