- When defining a type of mobile or remotely delivered service location:
  - `Location.mode` is sent as "kind"

  - Additional types of `Location.type` indicate the service is tailored for delivery in these kinds of locations (e.g. "AMB", "COMM", "PTRES", "SCHOOL", or "WORK").

  - `Location.type` is sent as "VI"
  - `Location.physicalType` is sent as "vi"
