This definition supports sending the Centrelink Customer Reference Number (CRN) (also referred to as unique identifier number (UIN) in the Centrelink Confirmation eServices (CCeS)) as displayed on the individual's Pensioner Concession Card.

A Pensioner Concession Card may be issued by Services Australia or Department of Veterans' Affairs (DVA) to pensioners and selected benefit recipients to assist them with certain living costs, by allowing access to specific goods and services at a concessional rate.

#### Usage Notes

Although a DVA-issued card will also include an individual's state-based DVA file number only the CRN should be sent as the Pensioner Concession Card number.
