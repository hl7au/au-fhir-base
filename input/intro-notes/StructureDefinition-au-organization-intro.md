### Usage Notes
When selecting a code for Organization.type, if a system is unable to provide a code from the preferred value set [Healthcare Organisation Role Type](https://healthterminologies.gov.au/fhir/ValueSet/healthcare-organisation-role-type-1) because the implementation context is not restricted to healthcare practitioner providers then it is recommended to select from the wider set available in SNOMED CT. If a suitable code from SNOMED CT is not available, a code from the code system [Australian and New Zealand Standard Industrial Classification (ANZSIC), 2006 (Revision 2.0)](https://www.healthterminologies.gov.au/integration/R4/fhir/CodeSystem/anzsic-2006-20130626) may be used.

Contact details and associated contact purpose are encouraged to be sent in Organization.contact over making use of the [Contact Purpose](StructureDefinition-contact-purpose.html) extension.
