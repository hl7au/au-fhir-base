### Usage Notes

HPI-O is used as an identifier in this profile to support the case where network HPI-Os are issued for sub-organisations, departments, or other logical divisions acting as specific healthcare services. This is useful in the absence of any specific national identifier for healthcare service entities.

To indicate the purpose of a contact point (e.g. telecom), the extension Contact Purpose could be used.

**Potentially useful extensions:**
* HealthcareService.telecom: [Contact Purpose](StructureDefinition-contact-purpose.html)
