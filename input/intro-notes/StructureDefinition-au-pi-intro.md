### Usage Notes

**Profile specific implementation guidance:**

- A patient internal identifier is differentiated from an MRN by the following:
  - An MRN uniquely identifies a patient in a specific institution (e.g. a hospital), and is intended to be referenced and shared by different applications within that institution. An MRN is assigned and managed by an assigning application (e.g. a Patient Master Index).  
  - A patient internal identifier uniquely identifies a patient within an application, and is not intended to be broadly shared with other applications as it is unique within the assigning application only.
