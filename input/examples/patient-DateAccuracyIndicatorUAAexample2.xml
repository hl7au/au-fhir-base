            <p>This example demonstrates how a birth or deceased date with unknown day, accurate month and year would be represented.</p>
            <p>Note that "1978-08-00" is NOT a valid FHIR date.</p>
            <p>Details include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>A valid FHIR date example for birth date and deceased date is "1978-08-21" but not "1978-08-00".</li>
                <li>A date accuracy indicator of "UAA" indicates that the day is unknown but month and year are accurate.</li>
                <li>When a code value contains "U", the corresponding date components (individual or combination) for birth or deceased dates must be ignored.</li>
                <li>When a code value contains "A", the corresponding date components (individual or combination) for birth or deceased dates must be accurate.</li>
