This page lists all the ValueSets and CodeSystems defined as part of this specification. 

As well as these included definitions this speification typically references [National Clinical Terminology Service (NCTS)](https://www.healthterminologies.gov.au/integration/R4/fhir) terminology resources. 

### Value Sets

### Code Systems

See the [FHIR terminology section]({{site.data.fhir.path}}terminologies-systems.html) for a complete discussion on code systems and a list of codes system names used in FHIR.  Most code systems used in this guide are defined in the base FHIR specification. The following code systems are unique to this guide and not listed in the base FHIR specification.  If a URI is listed here, it **SHALL** be used in the US Core profiles to identify the code system in preference to any other code system URI.


**Code systems published in this IG** - Includes US Core defined code systems and externally defined code systems
