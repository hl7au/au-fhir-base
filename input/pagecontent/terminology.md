This page lists all the ValueSets, CodeSystems, and ConceptMaps defined as part of the US Core implementation Guide. For more information on using codes in US Core, see the [FHIR Terminology] section in the FHIR specification and the [Coded Elements] section in this guide.

### Value Sets

These value sets have been defined for this implementation guide.

### Code Systems

See the [FHIR terminology section]({{site.data.fhir.path}}terminologies-systems.html) for a complete discussion on code systems and a list of codes system names used in FHIR.  Most code systems used in this guide are defined in the base FHIR specification. The following code systems are unique to this guide and not listed in the base FHIR specification.  If a URI is listed here, it **SHALL** be used in the US Core profiles to identify the code system in preference to any other code system URI.
