<p class="stu-note">We have introduced support for the following extensions: Individual Pronouns, Patient Sex Parameter For Clinical Use, Person Recorded Sex Or Gender. These extensions are published in this guide to pre-adopt the material published in the R5 <a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/extensions/1.0.0">FHIR Extensions Pack</a>. These extensions are an R4 (4.0.1) conversion of the canonical extension and may contain forwards incompatible data types when converted to R4 (see the extension page in this guide for information on any  material differences). Implementers are advised to take note that this content may be removed or changed and to take caution if using these extensions.</p>
