   - AU eRequesting
   - AU Provider Directory

#### FHIR Version Support
AU Base has been based on [FHIR Version R4](https://hl7.org/fhir/R4/index.html) since AU Base version 2.0.0. Prior versions were based on FHIR Version STU3. The next version of FHIR that AU Base will be based on has not been decided. It is under consideration on whether the next supported FHIR version is the upcoming FHIR Version R6 and not R5. As of the publication date, there is no timeline for this update.

#### Future Candidate Requirements Under Consideration
