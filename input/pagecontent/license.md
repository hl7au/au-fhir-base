### HL7 Australia Intellectual Property Policy
HL7 Australia has an overarching intellectual property policy in place. The [HL7 Australia - Intellectual Property Policy](https://hl7.org.au/fhir/hl7a_ip_policy.pdf) document defines the HL7 Australia organisation position on many aspects related to the copyright, licensing, liabilities and usage of HL7 Australia FHIR Implementation Guides. This also includes how the HL7 Australia FHIR Implementation Guides referencing other underlying material from HL7 International and 3rd parties shall be considered when using HL7 Australia published material. This policy document is maintained with the current official position of HL7 Australia with respect to these considerations.

HL7 FHIR® [Licensing and Legal Terms](https://hl7.org/fhir/license.html) should also be referenced as the underlying standards published terms on which HL7 Australia FHIR Implementation Guides depend.

A number of key considerations are included here to support HL7 Australia FHIR Implementation Guide usage.
